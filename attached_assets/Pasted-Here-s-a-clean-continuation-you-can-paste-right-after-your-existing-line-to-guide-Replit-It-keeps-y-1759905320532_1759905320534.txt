Use the provided services index as the single source of truth. Keep the on-page order exactly as given in my list from top to bottom.

Search input behavior

Match on keywords, synonyms, and partial words with basic fuzzy tolerance for typos.

Support plural and common variants, like tv vs television, faucet vs tap, outlet vs plug, caulk vs caulking, fence post vs post replacement.

Prioritize matches in this order: exact name match, tag match, synonym match, partial match.

If multiple items match, sort results by my original list order, not alphabetically.

Debounce input so results update after the user stops typing for a short moment.

Matching rules

Tokenize the query, lowercase, strip punctuation.

Use a tags array on each service for synonyms and common phrases.

Accept minor typos with a simple fuzzy threshold so leaking, leaky, leak all match.
