Frequently Asked Questions
Do you give estimates?

Yes — I can usually give a rough estimate over the phone after hearing a short description of your project or seeing a quick photo. Every job is different, so a quick call helps me understand exactly what’s needed and give you the most accurate guidance.
Call 425-442-9328 to discuss your project and get a clear idea of next steps.

Do you supply materials?

Yes — for most jobs, I can provide and pick up standard materials to keep things simple. If you already have specific items you want used, that’s fine too. We can talk through what makes the most sense during your call.
